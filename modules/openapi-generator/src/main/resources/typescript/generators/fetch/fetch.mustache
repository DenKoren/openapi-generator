# TODO:

# Generic for HTTP Library:

	# Generate one class for each api
		# constructor: Configuration + RequestFactory + ResponseProcessor
		# one method for each API
		# call request factory
		# execute request with http library or w/e other library
		# call response processor
		# return promise
		
		# Why is this good? Because it allows each generator to return whatever they want to return, but they rely on the same
		# internal process to get the response (if done correctly...)
		
# Export correctly configured apis!
